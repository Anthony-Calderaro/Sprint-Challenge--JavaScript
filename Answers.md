1.      The main difference between forEach and Map is that forEach will override the original array, whereas map will create a            new array to hold the results of the function. 
2.      (1) Objects
        (2) Arrays
        (3) Booleans
        (4) Numbers
        (5) Strings
        What is special about arrays is that they provide a way to store data in a stored manner. Unlike the other data types, arrays have indexes built into them which allow us to not only store data, but easily identify and return specific items by using a wide array (pun intended) of functions. For example, we can use a for loop to iterate over every item in an array, or we can use the filter function to return a sub-population of an array. 

3.      Closure is related to scope, and how variables outside of functions interact with variables called inside them. In                 Javascript, a variable may be declared "globally," so that it can be referenced in functions that are created later on,            without having to re-declare the variable each time.
